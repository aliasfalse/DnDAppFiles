				<name>Favored Foe</name>
				<text>(Replaces Favored Enemy)</text>

				<text>You can call on your bond with nature to mark a creature as your favored enemy for a time: you know the hunter's mark spell, and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for it. You can use it a certain number of times without expending a spell slot and without requiring concentration a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</text>
				<text>	When you gain the Spellcasting feature at 2nd level, hunter's mark doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.</text>

				<name>Tireless</name>
				<text>As an action, you can give yourself a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + your Wisdom modifier. You can use this special action a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</text>
